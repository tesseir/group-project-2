## PROJECT-TRACKER

# Description

The Project-Tracker is a simple web application for mindmapping. 
We built this project with the coders in mind. It provides a platform for organizing and project reference all in one place.

# How it Works

Once on the homepage, the user would either sign up for an account or log in. A username and password are required. Once this has been generated, then the user will be able to view previous projects or create a new one. Without a log in verification, only the lists of the mindmaps will be visible.
